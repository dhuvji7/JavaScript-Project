# 🏏 Bat Ball Stump Game

A simple and fun JavaScript game inspired by cricket!

This was my **first JavaScript project**, built using just **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS** to learn DOM interaction and basic game logic.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

Both the user and the computer pick one of three choices:

- **Bat 🏏**
- **Ball 🎾**
- **Stump 🧱**

### 🧠 Game Rules:

- **Bat 🏏 vs Ball 🎾** → **Bat wins**
- **Ball 🎾 vs Stump 🧱** → **Ball wins**
- **Bat 🏏 vs Stump 🧱** → **Stump wins**
- **Same choice** → It's a **tie**

The computer picks randomly each time, and the result is shown in an alert box.
